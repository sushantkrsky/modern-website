## ✨ Abstract

When it comes to proving yourself professionally, documentation that provides proof of your accomplishments or samples of your work is crucial. Portfolios are a great way to demonstrate the competencies you would list on a resume or talk about in an interview — they allow you to ***show*** and not just ***tell***.

## 🎯 Project Aim

This project involves building a responsive personal portfolio website that effectively highlights my diverse projects, extensive experience, and valuable skill set.
